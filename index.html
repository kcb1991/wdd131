                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Kyle Boat and my family is my everything. I have a gorgeous wife
                    that I have been married to for just over 10 years. We have four awesome kids
                    together. We reside in Moses Lake, Washington. We just bought our very first
                    home in January and we love it! I'm taking this class because I have always
                    liked working with computers and have always thought I would enjoy programming.

                <h2>Moses Lake - Washington</h2>
                <p>There as so many fun things to do in Moses Lake. Especially in the summer.
                    We go swimming, boating, and tubing. There is a farmers market and festivals
                    in the summer. There are also a lot of trails to hike.
